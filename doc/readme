   This directory contains all the required files for building a parser 
for the Tiny language.  

   To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "tiny".

   To test source code like "gcd.tiny", type "./tiny gcd.tiny" and the syntax
tree will be displayed on the screen.

   To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

   There is a parameter "NO_PARSE" in "main.c".  Its default setting is
FALSE, and the "make" will generate a parser using this value.  If we change 
the value to TRUE, the "make" will only generate a scanner.

   Note that it's important to use the option "-d" in "yacc -d tiny.y".  This 
will generate a list of token type values in "y.tab.h", which will be used
in "lex.yy.c" and "util.c".  Otherwise, the parser may not connect to the 
scanner properly and util.c may not display the syntax tree correctly.
