Wyatt Carss' C Minus compiler, 'cm'

Introduction:
	
	This is a simple scanner/parser which generates an abstract syntax
	tree for the C Minus language. There is some limited error recovery
	and syntax errors are printed to screen upon being found.

Usage:

	Install:
	type 'make' and hit enter to build.

	Run:
	type './cm <filename>' to see a scanner/parser printout for <filename>,
	which should be a C Minus file, ending in .cm

	Run for AST only:
	type './cm <filename> -a' to see only the syntax errors / abstract 
	syntax tree for the file <filename>

	Uninstall:
	type 'make cleanall' to clean the project back to source.

Tests:

	Inside of the '/doc' folder, you will find test files test[12345].cm

	test1.cm - compiles correctly.
	test2.cm - Has a 
	test3.cm - 
	test4.cm - 
	test5.cm -
